# Arcade Game Clone - Udacity Project
This game is based on the game Frogger. It is intended to meet the requirements of the Udacity [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) only. I will continue to make modifications beyond this and provide an update.

## Aim Of The Game
You are required to move the character from the starting position to the water at the top of the game canvas. You will need to avoid the bugs. If a bug hits you then your position will reset. Upon reaching the water your position will also reset.

## Installation
The following instructions are written for Goggle Chrome:
1. Download the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and install
2. Install [Web Server For Chrome] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)
3. Within the Web Server For Chrome pop-up window, locate the Arcade-Game folder on your machine and set Web Server For Chrome to run
4. Open index.html within Chrome

## How To Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move up, down, left and right.


## Future Updates
I plan to expand on the functionality of this game. This will include the following:
* Add gems to be collected
* Adding a life/heart counter
* Providing the option for the player to choose their character
* Adding a move and seconds counter
